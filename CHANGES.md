# Changes

## 19.9

- Initial project start
- Included bootstrap, made initial version of makefile
- Tested to make sure node-sass recursive watch mode will work. New files will not be watched until restart, but you can still rebuild by saving an upstream file. Need a fix for this.
- Still need to figure out a templating solution and building the source markup to the build directory. JS build needs to be figured out as well.
